# budgeting-application
A budgeting app used to review and improve on my JS skills (ES5)

I was originally going to clean up my comments and commit a "polished" version of the project but I decided to leave in the comments as they may be helpful to someone or even me in the future. 

# Note
This project isn't perfect, but it was a good project for me to refresh on JavaScript concepts and best practices. In the future, I will add a list of the concepts and best practices that I reviewed using this project.
